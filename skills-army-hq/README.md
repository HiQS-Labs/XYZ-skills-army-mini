# Skills Army HQ

## Primary Use Case

You're a developer working across three or more agentic coding environments:
Claude Code in VS Code, the Codex app, ZCode, and Antigravity. You've built an army
of skills you love, but they're scattered across different installations. Some
are up to date, some are older copies, and others never made it to every app.

Then you discover a great new skill. You ask Claude Code to install it for itself
and Codex, but forget Antigravity. Days later, you try to invoke that shiny new
skill in Antigravity—only to discover it isn't available.

Or you're fine-tuning a skill and forget to copy the latest version into every
target folder. Now each agent is working from different instructions.
Frustrating, right?

Skills Army HQ gives your skill army one headquarters. Talk to one system to
import and update your skills, then deploy them to your configured apps. It knows
your target folders and updates their links on your command.

The actual skill folders stay in one collection — since GH-536, `~/git-pulse-sync/Deployed Skills`, carried by the hourly Git Pulse writer (see SKILL.md → "Adopting the collection on another machine").
Each app points to those same copies through directory symlinks, so you can see
exactly what's deployed without maintaining separate versions for every agent.
Run a health check to spot missing links or conflicts; app discovery and runtime
readiness are verified separately.

## Origin

This skill comes from **XYZ Forge**, maintained in the
[HiQS-Labs/XYZ-forge repository](https://github.com/HiQS-Labs/XYZ-forge),
at `skills/skills-army-hq/`. It replaces `skills-sync-trinity`.

It gives your existing coding agent a conversational interface for managing a
durable collection of local skills. Ask it to “list my deployed skills”, “import
this local skill folder”, or “preview syncing my skills to the configured apps”.
The agent instructions live in the skill folder's `SKILL.md`.

## Source ownership

XYZ Forge is the authoritative source for this managed package. The
`HiQS-Labs/XYZ-Skills-Army-mini` repository is a generated projection: change managed files in
XYZ Forge, merge them, and republish. Do not maintain equivalent patches in both repositories.
Local collections and their receipts, targets, catalogs, history, backups, and imported skills are
operator-owned state and are never part of the generated repository.

## Where an installed copy lives

Initialization copies the **entire skill folder**, including this README, into
`~/git-pulse-sync/Deployed Skills/skills-army-hq/`. Updating the manager refreshes this
README along with its scripts and instructions. The installer also writes a real
copy at **`~/git-pulse-sync/Deployed Skills/README.md`**, beside `catalog.md`.
That top-level README is installer-managed and refreshed during applied operations;
keep personal notes in a separate file. It is an actual copy, not a link
back to the source checkout, so deleting a temporary clone does not remove it.
Configured apps receive directory symlinks to the durable skill folders.

The collection's `catalog.md` lists its skills, `targets.json` records deployment
destinations, and `changelog.md` records operations. Local source paths, available
Git revisions and payload digests are recorded in `.deploy-skills.json`; those
receipts identify the particular imported copy, whereas the link above identifies
the upstream project. Keep local receipts and imported private skills private.

## Getting started

Requires Python 3.9+; macOS is the supported alpha platform. From this `skills-army-hq` package
folder, choose a separate collection directory, preview initialization, then apply it. When starting
at the generated child repository root, first `cd skills-army-hq` (or use the root README's paths):

```bash
python3 ./scripts/intake.py --root "/path/to/Deployed Skills" init
python3 ./scripts/intake.py --root "/path/to/Deployed Skills" --apply init
python3 "$HOME/git-pulse-sync/Deployed Skills/intake.py" list
```

Targets start disabled. Ask your agent to configure the apps you choose, preview
the changes, and sync them. Operations preview by default; `--apply` writes.
Only local Git skill folders are imported; runtime dependencies are not installed.
Overwritten skill folders are backed up as dated ZIPs, with same-day suffixes.
Foreign app folders and unrelated links are preserved rather than overwritten.

## Health check

Ask your agent: **“Run a health check on my deployed skills.”** The health check
uses the existing sync tool's read-only status command; no separate script is needed:

```bash
python3 "$HOME/git-pulse-sync/Deployed Skills/sync.py" --status
```

It validates the local collection and reports missing or incorrect directory
symlinks for enabled targets, stale managed links, ownership conflicts, and recorded
runtime prerequisites. It does not copy, delete, repair, or change settings.
Apps share the durable skill copies through symlinks, not separate payload copies.

Read the report: `actions` are pending link changes, `changes` are pending ownership
updates, and `errors` are conflicts or validation failures. Deployment is in sync
when all three are empty. Exit code `2` indicates errors; **exit code `0` alone does
not prove health**, because pending changes can still be reported. Disabled targets
are not required deployment destinations. Ask for a sync separately to apply repairs;
foreign entries require explicit review rather than automatic replacement.

This is a filesystem deployment health check, not proof that an app or extension
has loaded a skill or that its runtime dependencies work. Report app discovery and
runtime readiness separately as verified or unverified.

Inside the `skills-army-hq` folder, see `references/targets.md` for app-specific
verification and `references/recovery.md` for backups, interruptions and migration.
